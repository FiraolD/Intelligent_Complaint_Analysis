| Why are people unhappy with BNPL services? | BNPL services have been criticized for being unaffordable, unreliable, and offering poor customer support. The high interest rates and fees associated with these services have made them unattractive to many consumers, and many report being frustrated by an inability to manage their debt effectively. Additionally, the lack of transparency and inability to dispute disputes have also been criticized, leading to dissatisfaction among customers who feel that they are not being treated fairly.

Another issue highlighted by customers is the lack of customer service options. Many BNPL platforms do not offer phone or email support, and customers are left to navigate complex systems on their own. This lack of support can be frustrating for customers who are trying to manage their finances, and some customers have reported abandoning BNPL services entirely.

We can also contact the credit card company directly and ask them about their policies on late fees, as well as other customer complaints about late fees.
